/**
 * The rows of Pascal's triangle are conventionally enumerated starting with row n=0 at the top.
 * The entries in each row are numbered from the left beginning with k=0 and are usually staggered relative to the numbers in the adjacent rows.
 * The triangle may be constructed in the following manner: In row 0 (the topmost row), there is a unique nonzero entry 1.
 * Each entry of each subsequent row is constructed by adding the number above and to the left with the number above and to the right, treating blank entries as 0.
 *
 *
 *                1
 *               1 1
 *              1 2 1
 *             1 3 3 1
 *            1 4 6 4 1
 *          1 5 10 10 5 1
